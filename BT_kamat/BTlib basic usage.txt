______________________________________________________________

To use this library, just include it at the top of your program like this:

#include "NXCDefs.h"
#include "BTlib.nxc"
______________________________________________________________

Use 

BTCommCheck(CONN);

to check if the NXTs are connected, where 
CONN must be set to 0 in the slave program, 
and must be set to 1,2 or 3 in the master program:
it returns 0 if there's an error, so you can stop the program, 
connect NXTs via menu and start program again.

______________________________________________________________

Use

BTWait(CONN);

to wait for a BT transaction to end, where CONN is defined as above.
______________________________________________________________

Use

BTSendMessage(CONN,MAILBOX,MSG);

to send a string message, specifying which connection CONN to use, 
to which mailbox MAILBOX send data 
and the message MSG itself. 
To send a number, first convert it to a string using NXC function 

s = NumToStr(n)
______________________________________________________________

Use

MSG = BTReceiveMessage(CONN, MAILBOX, FLUSH);

to receive a string message, specifying which connection CONN to use, 
from which mailbox MAILBOX pick the data, 
if you want or not to clear remote message (FLUSH). 
The function returns the message MSG.
